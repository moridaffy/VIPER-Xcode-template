When you decide to use VIPER architecture in your project, it is very tired create new modules, because you need create at least 6 files for each. Imagine that you need to create 6 modules...This template solves the problem and creates all files at once:
* Protocols
* Configurator
* ViewController
* Interactor
* Presenter
* Router

## How to install

### Using script (easy)
Just clone the git, open terminal, navigate to project's folder and run the following command:
```swift
sudo swift install.swift
```
After the installation is completed, you should see this:

## Why VIPER?
After using VIPER, I've found it to be very beneficial in many ways. Let’s get back to the list of things we set out to accomplish when architecting our app to see if VIPER addresses them.

- Easy to iterate on
- Collaboration friendly
- Separated out concerns
- Spec-ability

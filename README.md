When you decide to use VIPER architecture in your project, it is very tired create new modules, because you need create at least 6 files for each. Imagine that you need to create 6 modules...This template solves the problem and creates all files at once:
* Protocols
* Configurator
* ViewController
* Interactor
* Presenter
* Router

Just clone the git, open terminal, navigate to project's folder and run the following command:
```swift
